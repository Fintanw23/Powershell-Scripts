## connect-to-share.ps1 (may not be working correctly)
- requests user input of IP, Share Path and any credentials
- pings the IP and quits if there is no response
- Checks for unused drive letter
- Attempts to connect on success using any unused drive letter
- opens file explorer upon successful connection
### This may not be working 100% and it is usually easier to just run "net use Z: \\computer_name\share_name /PERSISTENT:YES"
